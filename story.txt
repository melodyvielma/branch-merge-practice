Here is where I'll put my awesome story!

Create a story that starts perhaps with "once upon a time" and ends with "and they all lived happily ever after", etc. in the master branch, and build your story on branches that must be merged and approved via a pull request.  You could also outline chapters, to assist in the process, or create a bare outline and fill in the details on branches.
